# EasyAirplaneDisabler

**Turn off Airplane mode directly from alert. This is a Theos iOS tweak.**

Compatible from iOS 11 to 13 (and probably more).

EasyAirplaneDisabler is a very lightweight tweak that changes the airplane alert to how it should have always been. What it does is replacing the "Settings" button with a "Turn Off" button.
As a bonus, the Turn Off button is localized so that it will be correctly translated for every languages!

No settings to configure. Just install and enjoy.
